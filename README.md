# Apromore_processminingdoc

Apromore supports the full spectrum of process mining functionality, from automated discovery of process models for tactical analysis, to real-time predictive monitoring for operational intervention. These features are complemented by an authoring environment for business process models, underpinned by an enterprise process repository.

  1. Shared workspace of models and logs
     
     Organize and seamlessly share your process models and event logs across the enterprise via a collaborative repository workspace.
     
  2. Discovery of process maps and BPMN models
  
     Automatically discover a process map or your “as-is” BPMN model from an event log, and dynamically switch between the two views. Change process perspective to focus on resources, roles, business object states and more. Apply abstraction mechanisms to create simplified views of your model.
     
  3. Visual filtering
  
     Focus on what matters more. Reduce the complexity of your process execution data by slicing and dicing your event logs by case variant, timeframe, a wide range of performance measures, specific execution paths, degree of rework, any attribute-value in the log and more.
     
  4. Performance overlays
  
      Analyze frequencies and durations of activities and handovers, using a range of statistic measures, overlaid on a process map or BPMN model.
      
  5. Flow comparison and multi-log animation
  
      Visually compare two or more process variants to identify structural differences. Animate variants simultaneously to understand differences in temporal dynamics.
      
  6. Rule-based and model-based conformance

      Compare “expected processes”, as represented by your to-be BPMN process models or a set of business rules, against ”actual processes” as recorded in your event logs, to spot discrepancies and assess their impact.
      
  7. Predictive process monitoring
  
      Train machine learning models to predict different process characteristics, and watch predictions refresh in real time, as your process cases unfold. Train your models for a variety of prediction problems, including case outcome, remaining time, next activity and case continuation. 
      
  8. Change detection and explanation
  
      Detect and explain undocumented changes (“drifts”) in your process behavior from your event logs. Segregate different process variants temporally (e.g. before, during and after a crisis) and compare the variants based on their flows, bottlenecks, frequency or rework, to identify sources of agility.
      
  9. Stage-based mining
  
      Discover logical stages of your processes and measure performance at each stage of your business process. Compare stages based on a range of performance statistics such as arrival rate, departure rate and exit rate, and assess their efficiency and knock-out effects.

# 2. Training

The tool has have trained hundreds of practitioners worldwide, both face-to-face and online, for over 15 years. Based on this experience, we have formulated a series of training modules on process mining, process modeling, analysis and redesign, using Apromore. Our teaching material is directly informed by our extensive research and continuous innovation in the field of process mining. Most importantly, it follows a pedagogical approach, so you can build your process mining skills, and more broadly, your process management capabilities, incrementally, via a series of case studies, examples and practical exercises.

they will also guide you, step-by-step, on how to use Apromore, from simple to advanced features, and have you practice at length with the product, so you’ll have all the means to take on Apromore with confidence, whether you simply want to start mining your own processes, or build an entire process mining function (a Center of Excellence) within your organization.

The tool also offer a public training course on Process mining vin partnership with The University of Melbourne. The course, structured over 2.5 days face-to-face or 10 online sessions of 1.5 hours each, illustrates the main techniques for process mining, discusses what analytics can be extracted, and how these can be visualized and interpreted to gain better insights on how an organization actually works. The course also illustrates how to run a process mining project, and how to gain internal support for triggering process mining initiatives within an organization. Using Apromore, the course provides plenty of hands-on opportunities to practice with process mining techniques.
